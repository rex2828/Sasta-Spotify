# HackOverflow
We are so exicted to share our idea and its working prototype with you guys. We had immense pleasaure while brainstroming ideas on this project under the HackOverflow hackathon.

We, thank you for this wonderful opportunity you have given to us.


# Problem Statement
We all listen to songs and thus, online song streaming platforms Spotify, Amazon music, Apple music and other indenious platforms have taken birth and have redefined the music industry.
As per the internal surveys, and feedback of music lovers around the globe there are two problems which are very commonly faced by users.

1. People listen to songs all the time, even while working. More than 50% people need lyrics while listening to songs. But streaming platforms have lyrics only in-built meaning users have to go in the app everytime to see lyrics which can be frsutating.

2. Even though people are listening to music online, there are still many users who need songs or some songs in their device for offline uses. No streaming platform gives that option without taking extra money. 


# Solution
*Our solution to this problem is a transparent application/widget which automatically shows time-synced lyrics of currently playing song, and gives options to download the song with two simple clicks.*    

# Prototype
                                  Our thoughts are stars , We cannot fathom into constellation


Due to time constratint and the amount of time it takes to add muliple functionality in an application of such magnitude we could only build a prototype which has the following features.  

⚫ With our website, you can **log in to your spotify account**

⚫ Our website detects the current playing song only if you click on the **Check Now Playing**

⚫ Our website shows thumbnail of current playing song and other details like artist name

⚫ Our website doesn't have time-sycned lyrics till now, instead it will show you **complete lyrics** of the currently playing song

⚫ Our website gives you **option to download** the current playing song with the button **Download Now**.
```
Interesting fact: Spotify recently added time synced-lyrics features due the demand made by multiple users and not every song has lyrics on Spotify, let alone time-sycned lyrics.
